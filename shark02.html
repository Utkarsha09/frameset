                        Sand sharks, also known as sand tiger sharks, grey nurse sharks or ragged tooth sharks, are mackerel sharks of the family Odontaspididae. 
                        They are found worldwide in temperate and tropical waters. The three species are in two genera.
                        The body tends to be brown with dark markings in the upper half. These markings disappear as they mature. 
                        <br>Their needle-like teeth are highly adapted for impaling fish, their main prey. Their teeth are long, narrow, and very sharp with smooth edges, with one and on occasion two smaller cusplets on either side. 
                        Sand sharks have a large second dorsal fin.[1] The sand shark can grow up to 3.2 m (10 ft) long, and most adults can weigh around 200 kg (440 lb). 
                        The average lifespan of both sexes is only about 7 years, though they may live longer in captivity.
                        <br>The sand shark has a unique hunting strategy. It is able to gulp air from above the surface and collect the air in its stomach. 
                        This enables it to become buoyant and approach its prey virtually motionless. During the day, the sand shark stays mostly inactive, but at night, it becomes active and resumes hunting activities. 
                        Its staple is small fish, but it eats crustaceans and squid, as well. 
                        It occasionally hunts in shivers (groups), and has even been known to attack full fishing nets.
                        <br>The family contains three extant species, in two genera, as well as many extinct species in several genera. 
                        Recent mitochondrial DNA analysis of extant members has found the two extant members do not actually form a monophyletic clade. 
                        This family is therefore polyphyletic and in need of revision.
