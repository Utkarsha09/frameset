                        Octopus is the largest genus of octopuses, comprising more than 100 species. 
                        These species are widespread throughout the world's oceans. Many species formerly placed in the genus Octopus are now assigned to other genera within the family. 
                        The octopus has 9 tentacles one on the back of its head averagely 20 cm long for an adult.
                        <br>Octopuses inhabit various regions of the ocean, including coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some live in the intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths. 
                        Most species grow quickly, mature early, and are short-lived. In most species, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female's mantle cavity, after which he 
                        becomes senescent and dies, while the female deposits fertilised eggs in a den and cares for them until they hatch, after which she also dies. 
                        Strategies to defend themselves against predators include the expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and threat displays, the ability to jet quickly through the water and hide, and even deceit. All octopuses are venomous, 
                        but only the blue-ringed octopuses are known to be deadly to humans.
                        <br>Octopuses appear in mythology as sea monsters like the Kraken of Norway and the Akkorokamui of the Ainu, 
                        and probably the Gorgon of ancient Greece. A battle with an octopus appears in Victor Hugo's book Toilers of the Sea, inspiring other works such as Ian Fleming's Octopussy. 
                        Octopuses appear in Japanese erotic art, shunga. They are eaten and considered a delicacy by humans in many parts of the world, especially the Mediterranean and the Asian seas.
