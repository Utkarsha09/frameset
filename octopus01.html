                    Grimpoteuthis is a genus of pelagic umbrella octopuses known as the dumbo octopuses. 
                    The name "dumbo" originates from their resemblance to the title character of Disney's 1941 film Dumbo, having a prominent ear-like fin which extends from the mantle above each eye. 
                    There are 15 species recognized in the genus. Prey include crustaceans, bivalves, worms and copepods. 
                    <br>The average life span of various Grimpoteuthis species is 3 to 5 years.
                    Species of Grimpoteuthis are assumed to have a worldwide distribution, living in the cold, abyssal depths ranging from 1,000 to 7,000 metres. 
                    Specimens have been found off the coast of Oregon, the Philippines, Martha's Vineyard, the Azores, New Zealand, Australia, California, Gulf of Mexico, Papua, and New Guinea. 
                    Dumbo octopuses are among the deepest living octopuses known. In 2020, Grimpoteuthis was spotted 6,957 m deep in the Java Trench.
                    <br>Specimens of Grimpoteuthis have been observed to swim by using movement of the fins. 
                    Although it has been suggested that species of Grimpoteuthis are capable of jet-propulsion, this has since been deemed unlikely. 
                    Movement of the arms can be used to help the animal move in any direction. The arms permit the animal to crawl along the seafloor, to capture prey, lay eggs, explore, etc.Dumbos hover above the sea floor,
                    searching for polychaete worms, pelagic copepods, isopods, amphipods, and other crustaceans for food. 
                    <br>Prey is captured by pouncing on the target, which then is swallowed whole.[34] In contrast to other octopuses, dumbo octopuses do not produce ink. This makes sense considering the fact that their habitat is a deep, dark place in the ocean. 
                    Instead of ink sacs, dumbo octopuses take advantage of a strand-like structure on their suckers to help light
